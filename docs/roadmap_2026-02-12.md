## High-Level Status (2026-02-12)

Since the last update on Feb 4th, we have achieved **major milestones** in the core execution engine and user interface.
The system now functions as a true end-to-end pipeline prototype: from Cinematic Prompt Engineering (CPE) to Job Scheduling and Worker Assignment.

### Key Achievements
1.  **DirectorsConsole CPE Integration**:
    *   Full cinematic preset engine (Camera, Lens, Lighting, Film Stock).
    *   Validation logic ensuring physical correctness (Rules Engine).
    *   Frontend UI: `CinematicSelector` with Visual/Text tabs and real-time validation.
2.  **Scheduler & Worker Service**:
    *   **VRAM-Aware Scheduling**: Jobs are assigned to workers based on memory requirements.
    *   **Worker Registration**: Dynamic worker discovery and status tracking (Idle/Busy/Offline).
    *   **Job Queue**: Pending jobs are automatically dispatched when workers become available.
3.  **Frontend-Backend Wire-up**:
    *   `ShotTable` -> `JobManager` -> `Scheduler` -> `Worker`.
    *   'Generate' button now triggers the full backend flow.
4.  **Security & Stability**:
    *   Fixed critical prompt injection bug in `job_executor`.
    *   WebSocket stability improvements (Heartbeat handling).

## Current Status vs Target (Updated)

| Dev Order | Area | Current Status (Feb 12) | Target | Phase |
|-----------|------|-------------------------|--------|-------|
| 1st | 버그/안정성 | **Stable** (WebSocket/Scheduler Fixed) | 에러 없이 기동, 구조화 로깅 | 0 |
| 2nd | 샷리스트 편집 | Basic Table + **CPE Integration** | Airtable급 편집 + 엑셀 왕복 | 2 |
| 3rd | 데이터 구조 | Manual | 컨펌 → 네이밍 컨벤션 자동 생성 | 3 |
| 4th | 이미지 생성 | **Job Creation & Scheduling Live** | t2i + i2i + 이미지 편집 AI | 4 |
| 4th | 프롬프트 | **CPE Engine Active** | LoRA + 컨트롤넷 + 캐릭터/환경 | 4 |
| 5th | 타임라인 | Skeleton | 프록시 편집 + 드래그 리사이즈 | 5 |
| 6th | DCC 연동 | None | Blender 브릿지 | 6 |
| 8th | 인프라 | **Scheduler / Worker Manager Active** | DB + JWT + 워커 장애 복구 | 8 |

## Next Immediate Steps (Priority)

1.  **Frontend E2E Verification**:
    *   Manually verify the 'Generate' flow (Automated testing faced environment issues).
    *   Add "Apply to All" for cinematic presets.
2.  **Job Progress Feedback**:
    *   Implement real-time progress bars in `ShotTable` via WebSocket.
    *   Display generated images (thumbnails) in the table.
3.  **Workflow Expansion**:
    *   Integrate actual ComfyUI workflows for `t2i` (Flux) and `i2v` (Wan/LTX).
    *   Currently using mock/test workflows for scheduling verification.
